# YY Series vehicles

The YY series is a fixed wing single motor 3 or 4 channel radio controlled aircraft series. They follow a classic-for-UAVs double tail boom set up.
As a companion to the YY aircraft, the CS Series is a tank drive series of radio controlled ground vehicles.

Both series operate on the same YY Series controller, which is not compatible with industry standard controllers because of the different value sending method.
Their communication is made via the NRF24l01 2.4GHz chip. They can both be powered by 2S batteries, and in the case of the YY series aircraft, they can also be powered by 3S batteries.
